        Hello! Iâ€™m Sneha C J, a passionate Software Engineer with a B.E. in Computer Science from the Bangalore
        Institute of Technology. With a CGPA of 8.97, I developed a strong foundation in programming and problem-solving.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-2 text-gray-700">
        I have worked on various projects, including a Counterfeit Note Detection System and an Autism Diagnosis
        tool, where I applied machine learning algorithms. I also built several applications, such as a College
        Events Management System and a Caesar Cipher encryption tool, showcasing my skills in both frontend and
        backend technologies.
      </p>

        Apart from coding, I am deeply interested in tech trends, nutrition, and sustainable practices. I am eager
        to contribute my skills to meaningful projects and solve real-world problems.
